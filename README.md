This is an EXILED plugin made entirely by me that contains multiple plugins inside denominated modules. It is based on a MariaDB database. This is basically for devs to use at their discretion.

It contains even its own module loader.

The modules are the following:
- AfkChecker
- AutoNuke
- Flashlights Battery
- MVP Screen
- Elevator time change
- Custom HUD
- Custom Lobby
- Leveling system
- Lights
- Webhook logs
- Pets
- PocketSuck
- RemoteKeycard
- RespawnTimer
- SCP 1162
- scp swap
- Spectator Count
- Stalky
- Poll system integrated in the hud
- Trusted Vote
- Subclasses (Discontinued W.I.P.)
